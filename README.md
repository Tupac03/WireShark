# Wireshark for Basic Network Security Analysis

## Objective

Learning how to capture some network traffic that is flowing through your machine now and analyzing already captured network traffic by opening a stored capture file in Wireshark. We'll learn the differences between Wireshark Capture and Display Filters.

Generating, capturing analyzing RADIUS, HTTP, DNS and Telnet Traffic. We will also go through Decrypting RADIUS password.

Generating, capturing analyzing encrypted protocols such as SSH and HTTPS .. also we will decrypt HTTPS Traffic.

### Skills Learned

- Capture and filter network packets
- Detect anomalies and suspicious activities
- Utilize Wireshark tools for effective network troubleshooting

### Tools Used

- Wireshark
- Powershell
- Command Prompt
- RADIUS Server

Created a key file to execute in WireShark to unencrpyt nrtwork traffic and applied it.

Ran the caputure filter once more, and looked into the conversations of the traffic
